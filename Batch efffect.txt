Dear Reviewer,

We sincerely appreciate your feedback and valuable insights on our manuscript.
 Your comments have greatly contributed to the quality of our work.

Regarding the issue of batch effect removal in our microarray dataset,
 we regret to inform you that we encountered challenges that prevented us from implementing this step in our analysis.
 While we recognize the importance of addressing batch effects to ensure data quality, 
we encountered specific limitations that made this task unfeasible. 
We would like to provide a comprehensive explanation for our decision:
 **Unavailability of Batch Information:**
   Unfortunately, we do not possess access to detailed batch information or phenotype data 
that could have assisted in the identification and correction of batch effects.
 Without this essential metadata, 
it becomes exceedingly difficult to accurately distinguish between technical and biological variation.
